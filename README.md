# Detecting-genuine-non-Gaussian-quantum-states

This repository contains the Mathematica code used to generate the figures of the paper â€œDetecting genuine non-Gaussian quantum states":

1. Benchmarks.nb: Evaluates the entanglement criteria for various non-Gaussian state families (Fig. 2).
2. NOON states.nb: Samples the photon-number output distribution of our proposed optical circuit for (lossy) NOON states to demonstrate the entanglement criteria's experimental robustness (Figs. 3,4,6-8).
