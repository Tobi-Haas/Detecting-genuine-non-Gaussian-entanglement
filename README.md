# Detecting genuine non-Gaussian quantum entanglement

This repository contains the Mathematica code used to generate the figures of the paper *Detecting genuine non-Gaussian quantum states*, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15831">arXiv:2504.15831</a>:

1. Benchmarks.nb: Evaluates the entanglement criteria for various non-Gaussian state families (Fig. 2).
2. NOON states.nb: Samples the photon-number output distribution of our proposed optical circuit for lossy NOON states to demonstrate the entanglement criteria's experimental robustness (Figs. 3,4,6-8).
